## C++ pool

2nd year pool

The C++ Seminar (or Pool) is a key moment in Epitech training.

Like the C-Seminar unit, it is intensive and highly instructive. 

We would advise you not to take it lightly and to work as seriously, and as consistently, as possible throughout the entire three weeks.

# TOPICS TO BE COVERED 

You will discover object-oriented programming through the fundamental elements of the C++ language. Classes, instances and methods will (almost) no longer be a secret! 

# SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED 

- Correct usage of the C++ language and its special features in relation to C. 

- The ability to produce a basic C++ program in Unix. 

- The ability to wake up early, be punctual and work regularly 

- The ability to be precise in the reading, and comprehension, of one's code.
